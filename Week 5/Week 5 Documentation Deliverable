Week 5 -- Curiosity-16 WIP Phase I Fine-tuning script & Interact Script (Transfer learning (Two phase fine-tuning on pre-trained model))

Mon - Sun - HuggingFace Documentation, HuggingFace Transformers Course, HuggingFace LLM Course, researching Curiosity-16 work, "The Annotated GPT-2", diving deeper into NLP via HuggingFace courses and other resources, continued rewrite.

--- Curiosity-16 WIP Scripts for Phase I Fine-tuning Script ---
-- The Deliverable of the UC EEP For Summer 2025 for Week 5 is a (further) rewritten WIP script for Curiosity-16 LLM (PyTorch-based LLM utilizing GPT-2 that was built on beyond Curiosity-14 from EEP Summer 2024 Research Session)


--- Trouble I ran into:
--- I didn't run into too much trouble. The biggest issue is making sure that Curiosity-16 ends up being a much better model from Curiosity-14 and Curiosity-15. The more avdnaced concepts
I needed help with last year, I am learning about now (whereas last year was more "novel" and "rudimentary". For Curiosity-16, these scripts are WIP, but my aim is to have every script written 100% by me! Making sure I understand each and every
concept that I needed help with or didn't understand last year is imperative for my learning.
--- Picking Datasets that encompasses "vast swathes of data" for Phase I.
--- Deciding (still) whether to rewrite the preprocess function.

--- Additional Context:
--- Two-phase transfer learning for Curiosity-16 is coming soon. I need to make *even* more progress on the HuggingFace courses, but feel very good about my progress. I think Curiosity-16 will run just fine on my M4 Mac Mini, 
although I might need to look into LoRA adapters in order to save system memory. 16GB unified memory might serve as a bottleneck or I might run into a OOM error during the process. Time will tell. Adjusting gradient batches and learning rates will assist here.


--- What's Next:
--- Finalizing Interact, Fine-tuning scripts (Phase I and Phase II) for Transfer Learning. (Curiosity-16), finding seven more datasets for Curiosity-16 Phase I fine-tune script.
