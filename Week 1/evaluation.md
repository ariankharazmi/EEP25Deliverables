# Curiosity-14 (EEP 2024 Model) vs Curiosity-15 (Post EEP2024–2025 Model) — EEP 2025 Research Co-op Session Evaluation - Week 1 Deliverable: "What Went Wrong?"

This simple benchmark compares the response quality and behavior of Curiosity-14 and Curiosity-15 across twenty random prompts. Each response is graded in three main areas: factualness, coherence, and verbosity. The total score for each will be graded (by mself) and will go up to 3 total points. 1 Point = Full Credit, 0.5 Points = Partial Credit, 0 = No Credit. Curiosity-14 was tested using an interactive prompt in the script, while Curiosity-15 was tested via it's Ollama variant.

Who is responsible for the creation of the moon? And how did it function during the history of the universe? (You can also ask the question by asking the question "where did the moon come from?", and it won't be long before you'll be able to answer the question.)   The answer depends on a few factors: first, the moon was a relatively small creature, with a relatively short lifespan; second, it was a relatively large and highly evolved organism; and finally, it was one of the first to orbit the sun, which was an extremely rare event.   At the dawn of the solar system, the moon was a very young, young star, which was around 200 million years old.    It was also around 200 million years old when the first planets were discovered, and by the time we're about to see our first known planet orbiting, it was about 300 million years old.    The first known object to do so was the sun, which was about 200 million years old.   So, how did the moon evolve?   Well, it evolved into a very young, young star.

# Conclusion:

What this shows us, is that despite the purported technological differences between the two, neither model is truly ready to be shipped for public use. These models are both openly available via GitHub, HuggingFace, and Ollama, but serve as experimental models to assess response quality, rather than actually use as a conversational model.

# Starting Points for Curiosity-16:

## Training Foundations:

Curiosity-14 used three general knowledge HuggingFace datasets, and Curiosity-15 used four. For Curiosity-16, a larger number of datasets to train on would likely yield better results post-training & validation. For Curiosity-16, 8+ datasets would likely result in substantially better results.

## Fine-tuning Foundations:

Curiosity-14 did not have a fine-tuning process, Curiosity-15 relied on a 5MB json file for fine-tuning, leading to more "focused" responses, but it likely overfit on poor, noisy, and small amounts of data, losing coherence. For Curiosity-16, a 30MB+ json file that uses prompts and responses from a high-quality data source (such as the Stanford Alpaca Instruction Sets) would likely produce better results, stave off overfitting, and keep coherence.

# Repetition Penalty:

For Curiosity-16, it would be wise to include a small repetition penalty to avoid the loops that Curiosity-14 and Curiosity-15 tend to fall back to.

# Model Choice:

Curiosity-14 and Curiosity-16 were developed using GPT-2 Technologies (GPT-2-Small (124M Parameters) + GPT-2Tokenizer) using a Quad Core Intel i3 2018 Mac Mini with 8GB of RAM (x86). For Curiosity-16 to keeps its focus on being developed using consumer-grade hardware, Curiosity-16 should be developed via an M4 Mac Mini (16GB unified Memory) (ARM), and use a larger GPT-2 Model, such as GPT-2-Medium (355M Parameters) and AutoTokenizer (newer than GPT-2 Tokenizer, has a larger Context Window, which is better for short term memory retrieval).
